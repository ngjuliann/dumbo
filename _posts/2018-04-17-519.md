Snail 11
<br>

Oooooo. A handwritten one - from paper torn from a notebook. You went out of your way after you started this on your computer only because I missed out on Snail 4. I truely do appreciate. I love the rambles you go on, and its such a joy to read.

The little drawing at end. I just died. It's so cute. I love it. 


Miss you lots
