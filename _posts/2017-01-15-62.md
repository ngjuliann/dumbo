Goodbye Ottawa 
<br>
It's been decided that I won't be staying in Ottawa. I don't know how many days I have left. I don't know where I am going. I shared with you a brief summary of my education from when I was a kid to the adolescent I am now. I still treasure you as a friend despite everything. Remember that. 
<br>

*I'm sorry, I didn't mean to leave you*
