Goodbye Ottawa 
<br>
It's been decided that I won't be staying in Ottawa. I don't know how many days I have left. I don't know where I am going. I shared you a brief summary of my education as a kid to the adolescent I am. I still treasure you as a friend despite everything. Remember that.

*I'm sorry, I don't mean to leave you*
