Cafe Hops
<br>
Your love of coffee and cafes brought me down to Toronto. I met you, Daphne, and Roy at Union Station and thus one more thing was checked off the list. This time around, you showed me around and took me places. I merely followed and wanted to make this day trip last. A trip back to Union station and they had no economy seats back up the following day. I opted for a business class upgraded. I wanted that extra day just to spend with you.

*Is this our last trip?*
