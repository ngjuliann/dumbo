Snail 14
<br>

A handwritten snail slash coffee experience. You honestly didn't have to hand write it, but since you didn't bring your laptop it became a snail.  You shared about Dark Horse and the history you had there and to be honest, it didn't bother me one bit. Rather, I loved that you did share them with me to read. Perhaps I just like to know more of you therefore I'm very open to it. 
You sent me a Neo card for they didn't have theres, and no, it dosen't count. 

It felt like three snails in one to be honest. Dark Horse in Toronto, Dana visiting, and then hanging out at Roy's.  

It was a good read, and the handwritten aspects makes it a better experience. So there's that. I hope all is well.
