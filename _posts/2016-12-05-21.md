Fight or Flight.

I couldn't handle it. It hurts so much. While at MRT, I was sitting at one table with Thummim. You; the next table with Daphne facetiming a friend. I just couldn't. I needed an escape. I walked out into the cold and called Americans Airlines and redeemed tickets I had previously cancelld.
