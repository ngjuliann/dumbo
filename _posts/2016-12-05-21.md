Fight or Flight. 
<br>
I couldn't handle it. It hurt so much. While at MRT, I was sitting at one table with Thummim. You; the next table with Daphne, facetiming a friend. I just couldn't. I needed an escape. I walked out into the cold and called American Airlines and redeemed tickets I had previously cancelled.
