Goodbyes
<br>
Just another day, where everyone was at MRT. I showed up in flip-flops and brought Tims for everyone. I enjoyed the company one last time before I finished packing at home

I came back one last time to give you a hug and say goodbye. 

I'm sorry, I couldn't stay.

*I'll be back, I promise you*
