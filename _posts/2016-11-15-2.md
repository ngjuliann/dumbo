Ramen. 
<br>
I was working at the Canadian Museum of Nature.  It was a decent shift. As I got off work, I once again jokingly asked you on Snapchat if you wanted to go eat. I met you, along with Daphne, at MRT. We then headed to Ginza Ramen on Elgin. Thus Ramen date was coined. You and Daphne. Little did I know the impact you'd both have on me.
