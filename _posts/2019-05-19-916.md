That Person
<br>
that person
started May 17, 2019 
San Francisco

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
Blessed beyond words.
Being able to see you in a state of bliss
I wish it could last.

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
It’s okay to be selfish, 
I wanted you to be selfish.
Tell me what you want
I’ll try to make it happen

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
Our paths crossed once again
I missed you
I felt relevant once again
What have I gained?

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
I have nothing to prove
No hidden agendas
I want to hold you in close
But only if you let me

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
Stop going with the flow
Stop following footsteps
Make your decisions 
Make your own footsteps

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
I want nothing in return
Absolutely nothing 
Literally nothing
Nothing

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
Pay it forward, not back
Take what you can
I have nothing great to offer
Enjoy it

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
As we go on our own way once again 
We’ll meet again
Another adventure awaits
Mimi and Momo

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
Only if you let me
Only if you want me
Just gotta deal with it
Who’s going to love the one who loves others?

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
You are loved
Loved for who you are
Relentlessly loved
Loved

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
I hope you do find that person
You’re amazing and you should know it
There’s a million thing I would do
Things to do in a blink of eye

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
I hope he treats you right
Better than I ever could
Make me a distant memory 
But keep the impression

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
I hate that I’m too good for my own good
I love you too much to harm you for my own
I hate how selfish thoughts consume me
I love you ya know

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
But you’ll always be my person
Let me spoil you
Be content
No strings attached 

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
The way you do your makeup and hair
The way you eat
The way you love

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
You’re still my kryptonite
Call me and I’ll be there
I’ll fly you across the world to be anywhere
Anything you need

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
I want to love you
I want to keep you
I want you
“And thats okay”

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
I want to outdo myself
Bring you new experiences
Bigger and better memories
No ulterior motive

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
And its not about me
Have I forgotten where I stand
Its you above me
For you

Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
But I’ll always be here
Always here for you
Nothing to big or too small
Anything



Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
Maybe I’m just this (concept). 
Maybe I’ll never be that person, and thats okay.
Maybe it’ll kill me and I’m fine with that.

Who is he?
May 19, 2019

He drives a sports car around a new city 
He’s accompanied by old company
He hasn’t had good company for a while
He takes her out to places she’s never been and neither has he
He missed her
He drives and reaches out to hold her hand
She lets him take it

He was reunited with his coffee company 
He would buy her anything, anything that caught her eye
He was content
He wants to spoil her
He wants to love her
He wants her to be content
He needed her to be content
He treads cautiously
He drives dangerously

He enjoyed every second, every single second
He was dazed for the briefest second
He was bounded by a square and semicircle
He hesitantly sought permission
He wanted no misunderstanding 

He had no desire to win hearts
He had no goals to meet
He only wanted her to be herself
He only wanted her to be herself, happily

He flew her across the continent
She now had to fly back
He wanted her to stay, to stay forever
He kissed her on the cheek, the furthest he would allow himself to go
He didn’t want to overstep
He wanted to take the smallest space in her life

He gets in his car
She gets on her plane
He reaches out for a hand that doesn’t exist anymore
He drives on and on, longing

I’m sorry Friends Blendo.

not that person; but that person

So, I’m not sure where to start really. Do I respond to each chunk? Or as a whole? Guess we’ll see.

But you. You. 
Are full of surprises.

I’ve missed you. I really have.

If I’m being honest, I was nervous about coming. I didn’t know what you expected, what you wanted from me. I didn’t know what I could give; what I could provide.

I hate that you do so much for me. For someone who really doesn’t deserve anything. It feels as if you literally gain nothing, but I gain everything, why is that? Why is it that you do what you do?
I’ll never know.

But, despite my (not-so-subtle) hesitance? I was excited. To go on another adventure with you.To travel with you. To see you. To trust you. I knew that despite my quiet and conforming side, I knew you enough to still be me and not be afraid to speak up if needed. I’ve lost confidence over the past year, but I’ve also gained confidence, if that makes sense. 

I was tired of letting things dictate who I am and what I do. I know that you expect nothing, but you know me, and you know I’ll always be indebted to you. For just existing. For being such an incredible blessing in my life. You deserve so much more and if I could, I would give you the world.

It’s bittersweet every time you leave, but I guess this time, I’m the one leaving. But it’s not forever, it never is. Look forward to what 2020 holds for us.

I love you, I hope you know that, and I love you endlessly. Perhaps it’s not the way you wish, and for that, I’m sorry. But it’s a love that I don’t think will ever expire: the purest friendo blendo form of love.

I don’t think I’ll ever meet someone that’ll treat me the way you do. I wouldn’t want them to anyway. What we have is special and clearly, unexplainable to everyone but ourselves. If I meet someone, we’ll have our own thing, but nothing that could ever replace you, know that.

Be selfish sometimes. Listen to yourself for goodness sake. Do what makes you happy. Find someone that makes you happy. Find someone that deserves all this and more.

But all in all, I may not be that person for you, but you’ll always be that person for me; my person. 

Thanks again for doing all that you do. For loving me. For taking care of me. For being Julian.


P.S. I’m soooooo gonna be in trouble but hey, I would do it all over again if I could.
