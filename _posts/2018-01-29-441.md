Quitters Pt. 2
<br>
Back to where everything began. Your love for Quitters is a minor detail. I was ~~leaving~~ parting once again. I love this place. Its london fog is aromatic, and the cup is ever-so perfect. We got seats this time, and Quitters was as perfect as I remembered. Your company was perfect. 

*Why can't I stay?*
