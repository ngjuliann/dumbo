Snail 4
<br>
I picked up snail four as I went to mail you some snails. On my way home from Dumbo, snail 4 escapes me. Honestly, I have no idea where it ended up. 

Today was also the day you recieved my February snail. In your spirit of opening packages, I let you open Dumbo. Your reaction was genuine and it was beautiful. Dumbo was now yours, albeit nine days early, but it's a minor detail.
