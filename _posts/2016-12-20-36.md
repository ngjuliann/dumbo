FSS.

I thought we were on good enough terms. I thought I could handle studying with everyone. I thought I could handle your presence. You owed me no explanation, you were just being you. I sat down and tried to bs the rest of my final paper. I looked up and I see someone else make you smile more than I could have. I looked up and it felt like I've been stabbed, not in the back, but a point blank in the chest. I took it. You deserve to be happy. You deserve someone who doesn't envy. I slammed my Macbook shut and walked out the door. After all, I'm just a ~~friend~~ somebody.
