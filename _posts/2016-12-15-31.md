The Fifth. 
<br>
It's been two days since I got back. What was the state of our relationship? Acquaintances? Strangers? In three weeks, I've learned so much about you. I got you a gift before I ran away. The Fifth watch. I happened to get myself a pair too. I dropped off the gift and left you to it.

*Happy birthday to me?*
