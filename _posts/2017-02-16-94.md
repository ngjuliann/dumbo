BitterSweet

How did we end up in Montreal? The night before, while at Origin, this small idea came into our minds. Before we knew it, we are living in this idea. We had tweleve hours in Montreal. A getaway. I think one reason why this trip really happen was because I was leaving in less than two weeks. 


- Crew Collective & Co
- Xavier Artisan 
- Club Monaco St. Catherine St 
- Kinton Ramen 
- Big in Japan 
- Schwartz's Deli



Crew Collective and Big in Japan were definite highlights. The barist at Crew complimented on our matching Juno Awards crewnecks. The signature Tokyo Mule cockatail hits the spot. I enjoyed tequila and discovered a fondness for them. I embraced your company more as I knew I was leaving. 

I will be back soon, I promise.



*Will you wait for me?*
