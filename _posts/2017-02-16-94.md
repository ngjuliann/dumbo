How did we end up in Montreal? The night before, while at Origin, this small idea came into our minds. Before we knew it, we were living in this idea. We had twelve hours in Montreal. A getaway. I think one reason why this trip really happened was because I was leaving in less than two weeks. 


- Crew Collective & Co
- Xavier Artisan 
- Club Monaco St. Catherine St 
- Kinton Ramen 
- Big in Japan 
- Schwartz's Deli



Crew Collective and Big in Japan were definitely highlights. The barista at Crew complimented our matching Juno Awards crewnecks. The signature Tokyo Mule cocktail hit the spot. I enjoyed tequila and discovered a fondness for them. I embraced your company more as I knew I was leaving. 

I will be back soon, I promise.



*Will you wait for me?*
