Single By 30. 
<br>
It was another Sunday. We walked from Arlington Five back to uOttawa.  Once again I was in your room along with Daphne. I decided to go get Chinese food in Nepean. As I left, you messed with my Spotify as I was driving. I was actually so confused, I pulled over, and then realized what was happening. When I came back as you and Daphne were coming down, we saw Julia and the other bunch of people. After dropping Daphne off, I decided to take you to Bate Island which was promptly followed by Gatineau. We were driving up into Gatineau Park and my dad called. You tried to snapchat it and I tried to stop you. I gave up driving and you drove. You said it has been a while since you drove. We drove deeper into the park until we couldn’t and then parked at McDonald’s where I had a few bites of dinner. Followed by the Ministry of Coffee on Wellington which stopped serving coffee because it was so late. You settled for an earl grey instead. This adventure happened all while you were in Birks. After this late road trip adventure, we watched Single by 30. Passing out a few times here and there. We didn’t finish it. You seemed so comfortable leaning on me, I didn’t dare move. When dawn broke and as I left, I made the same “ballsy” gesture again.

*Will you be single by 30?*
