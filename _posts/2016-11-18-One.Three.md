Day Four. Volkswagen Jetta. 
<br>
From our conversations, I deduced that you enjoy cafes and coffee. Personally at the time, I enjoyed cafe aesthetic and vibes. Coffee not so much.... I wanted to "impress" you. Cafe Cristal was on my list. I got a ZipCar and picked you up at school. I honestly can't believe you got into that Blue Volkswagen Jetta. We headed to Cafe Cristal, and to be honest the only thing I remember from it was not the coffee. We said we might come back and try the high tea, but the highlight was me trying to eat a waffle which had powdered sugar. All that sugar ended up on my new pair of Black pants.

Did some girl I just met and barely know, willingly got into a car with me and headed into the middle of nowhere?
