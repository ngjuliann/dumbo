Toronto Spots
<br>
Your love for coffee and cafes made me stay another day in Toronto. For the first time ever, I took a bus in the Greater Toronto Area, from Richmond Hill to Finch. We were going to meet at Bloor-Yonge station, but it had no phone reception. Would you ever show up?

You did eventually. You took me to 7 West Cafe for brunch. I loved it. The Toronto Coffee Hop Tour continued

- Jacked Up Coffee
- Sorry Coffee Co
- Boxcar Social - 70 Temperance St
- Odin Cafe + Bar
- Tandem Coffee
- The Black Canary Espresso Bar 

In the middle of cafe hopping, we went ice skating at Nathan Phillips Square. You took a break leading, and I lead you hand in hand. Thankfully neither one of us fell. It was fun, it brought me joy to see you smile. 

In the midst of everything, we ended up getting matching pairs of shoes. At the end of the day, you asked me which was my favourite cafe of the trip. Odin Cafe + Bar was definitely up there. 

*I'll take you places soon, okay?*
