Toronto Spots
<br>
Your love of coffee and cafes made me stay another day in Toronto. For the first time every, I took a bus in the Greater Toronto Area, from Richmond Hill to Finch. We were going to meet at Bloor-Yonge station, but it had no phone reception. Would you ever show up?

You did eventually. You took me to 7 West Cafe for brunch. I loved it. The Toronto Coffee Hops Tour continued

- Jacked Up Coffee
- Sorry Coffee Co
- Boxcar Social - 70 Temperance St
- Odin Cafe + Bar
- Tandem Coffee
- The Black Canary Espresso Bar 

In the middle of the cafe hops. We went ice skating at Nathan Philips Square. You took a break leading, and I lead you hand in hand. Thankfully neither of us fell. It was fun, it brought joy to see you smile. 

In the midst of everything, we ended up getting  matching pairs of shoes. At the end of the day, you asked for my favourite cafe of the trip. Odin Cafe + Bar was definetly up there. 

*I'll take you places soon, okay?*
