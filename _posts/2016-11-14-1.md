First Contact. 
<br>
This was the day where everything began. I was at MRT with Daphne just chilling and studying. Through her we started Snapchatting each other. I called you Mimi and you called me Momo. I jokingly asked you to come visit before you went to eat in the caf. Out of the blue, you showed up and plopped down next to Daphne.  I couldn't even look at you straight.

*Why did you surprise me so?*
