Volkswagen Jetta.

From our conversations, I deduced that you enjoy cafes and coffee. Personally at the time, I enjoyed cafe aesthetic and vibes. Coffee not so much.... I wanted to "impress" you. Cafe Cristal was on my list. I got a ZipCar and picked you up at school. I honestly can't believe you got into that Blue Volkswagen Jetta. We headed to Cafe Cristal, and to be honest the only thing I remember from it was not the coffee. We said we might come back and try the high tea, but the highlight was me trying to eat a waffle which had powdered sugar. All that sugar ended up on my new pair of black pants. 

Afterwards, we grabbed Origin and you tried to look for that dock by Rideau River. It wasn't there and we just walked around in the cold.

*Did some girl I just met and barely knew, willingly get into a car with me and head into the middle of nowhere?*
