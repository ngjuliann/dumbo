Snail 9
<br>
Snail 9 was a good read. It reminded me of my time when I broke down. The moment where my option was to leave Canada and figure what to do next. The moment where I found out I'd leave Ottawa and move to Australia. It was a very eye-opening time. It brought back those memories.

I'm excited for what He has planned for you.
