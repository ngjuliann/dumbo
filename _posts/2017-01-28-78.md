Happy Goat. Happy Mimi
<br>
You sent an open invitation to me after praise practice. This is a day I'll never forget. This is the day we hit ~~reset~~ refresh. I still can't fathom the about of joy knowing you can continue being in my life. Lines are drawn and boundaries set. You understood me, as I, you. The best coffee company ever. It was a mature moment for both of us; move on despite what has happen, thus open wounds became scars. 
<br>
I can not articulate how thankful I am.
