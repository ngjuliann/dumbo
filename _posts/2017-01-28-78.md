Happy Goat. Happy Mimi
<br>
You sent an open invitation to me after praise practice. This is a day I'll never forget. This is the day we hit ~~reset~~ refresh. I still can't fathom the joy of knowing you can continue to be in my life. Lines were drawn and boundaries set. You understood me, as I, you. The best coffee company ever. It was a mature moment for both of us; move on despite what has happen, thus open wounds became scars. 
<br>
I cannot articulate how thankful I am.
<br><br>
*Was it the right place and right time?*
