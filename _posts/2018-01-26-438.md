I was in Los Angeles. I had tickets to Canada since Novemeber 2017, but nobody knew. I wanted to come surprise everyone. 

I met you at Trainyards where traffic delays gave my surprise away. Once again we grab a cup of Orign's finest and headed to Rockcliffe Pavilion. Now that I was here, what did we want to do? 

__Montreal it was.__
Why not? It was ten at night, and we booked an Airbnb and off we went. We arrived around two hours and a speed camera flash later. We finished off the dumplings I brought from Toronto and we headed to our spot, Big in Japan. It was pumping. We wondering who the man in the middle was, super peppy, and just floating around. He was the owner. Once again, we enjoyed a Tokyo Mule, tequila shots, albeit I think I had more vodka, but this was different. Shots on the house, great bar tenders. It was (candle) lit in Japan. I remember there was one shot left, and the two bartenders played rock, paper, scissor on our behalfs. She lost/he won, and I downed that vodka shot. Chatting in cantonese with one them, we stayed past closing, I honestly didn't want that night to end. 

This trip to Montreal was of a different note. It wasn't that I was leaving, it was I was visiting. Oh how I wish I could stay. Coming back, I saw how you have matured and growed. I was proud, but I never mentioned it.
