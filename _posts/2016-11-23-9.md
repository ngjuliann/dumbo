Quitters. 
<br>
I think this day had the biggest impact. Once again you got into a car with me. A red Toyota Rav4 it was. Your love for Rav4s was fueled by the white Rav4 you had back home in Toronto. I brought you to Quitters. It was on your list of places, as it was on mine. I did a terrible parking job out on the snow covered streets, and the place had no seating. We ordered our drinks and headed back into the comfort of the Rav4.
<br>
I said how I felt. It wasn't exactly what I wanted, but a part of me saw hope. I should have respected your decision rather than try to find what I wanted. 
<br>
I remember driving around in frustration that night. Directionless. I just drove.
