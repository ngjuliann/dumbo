Feelings Are Stupid. 
<br>
Post-OKC,C a bunch of us went to Deja-Vu to study. You joined us later. Somehow I ended up next to you and leaned on your shoulder. One by one everyone left. Enoch was also visitng the weekend, and I left you to have dinner with him. I brought you a Venti Starbucks back, but you weren't there. Nobody was. Your stuff was still around though. I left the drink and hid to watch your reaction. Surprise! As time passed I fell asleep in your lap, and as your co-worker called, "Feelings are stupid", was repeated three times. Eventually we got kicked out into MRT. I headed home a while after. <br><br>
*Were you as comfortable as I was?*
