T-Minus One Days
<br>
One last final day, one last final trip. I chose to spend it with you. I got the trusty Rav4, picked you up, and we started the day at Baker St. Cafe. Oh I remmeber how there was just so much on the plate. We ended up at Equators and grabbed one cuppa each for the road. Once again, I took you places and you had no idea where we were headed. Good times, but will this be the last?

There was a bridge in the middle of ~~nowhere~~ Wakefield. It was a beautiful, red-painted, wodden bridge. We hung off it, and thoroughly enjoyed each other's company. 

Then there was Cafe Molo. Its warmth was from a wood-fired oven. It's coffee never tasted any better. Your company was perfect. The smile on your face, not just your mouth, you never looked better. 

I will never forget this day.

*I'll take us to bigger bridges*
