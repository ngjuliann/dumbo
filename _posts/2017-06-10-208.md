Happy Birthday
<br>
Okay, so it didn't exactly happen on this day, but this day was the reason. It was your birthday. I had an elaborate plan where I would come back and surprise you. It didn't go through. 

You were moving out of res and I wanted to make a small mark in your new room. It took about a month of planning for me send you that Map of Montreal. Shoutout to Daphne for getting the frame, putting together, and hiding it under the same roof as you. I honestly hope you enjoy this small little gift. I hope it brings back good memories. 


*Meet you in Montreal?*
