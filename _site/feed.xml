&lt;p&gt;Day Four. Volkswagen Jetta. 
&lt;br /&gt;
From our conversations, I deduced that you enjoy cafes and coffee. Personally at the time, I enjoyed cafe aesthetic and vibes. Coffee not so much…. I wanted to “impress” you. Cafe Cristal was on my list. I got a ZipCar and picked you up at school. I honestly can’t believe you got into that Blue Volkswagen Jetta. We headed to Cafe Cristal, and to be honest the only thing I remember from it was not the coffee. We said we might come back and try the high tea, but the highlight was me trying to eat a waffle which had powdered sugar. All that sugar ended up on my new pair of Black pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day Two. Ramen. 
&lt;br /&gt;
I was working at the Canadian Museum of Nature.  It was a decent shift. As I got off work, I once again jokingly asked you on Snapchat if you wanted to go eat. I met you, along with Daphne, at MRT. We then headed to Ginza Ramen on Elgin. Thus Ramen date was coined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I met you and Daphne. Little did I know the impact you’d both have on me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Chapter1" /><summary></summary></entry><entry><title>November 14, 2016</title><link href="/One.One-copy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="November 14, 2016" /><published>2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/One.One copy</id><content type="html" xml:base="/One.One-copy/">&lt;style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day one. First Contact. 
&lt;br /&gt;
This was the day where everything began. I was at MRT with Daphne just chilling and studying. Through her we started Snapchatting each other. I jokingly asked you to come visit before you went to eat in the caf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Out of the blue, you showed up and plopped down next to Daphne.  I couldn’t even look at you straight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Chapter1" /><summary>Where it all began</summary></entry><entry><title>Mimi</title><link href="/Begin/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mimi" /><published>2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/Begin</id><content type="html" xml:base="/Begin/">&lt;style&gt;
