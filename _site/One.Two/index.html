<p>Day Two. Ramen. 
<br />
I was working at the Canadian Museum of Nature.  It was a decent shift. As I got off work, I once again jokingly asked you on Snapchat if you wanted to go eat. I met you, along with Daphne, at MRT. We then headed to Ginza Ramen on Elgin. Thus Ramen date was coined.</p>

I met you and Daphne. Little did I know the impact youâ€™d both have on me.</p>
